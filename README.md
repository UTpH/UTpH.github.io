## About Me

I am a first year Masters student @ [New York University’s](https://www.nyu.edu/) [Courant Institute of Mathmatical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/). I am majoring in Computer Science and my interests include Natural Language Processing & Computer Vision. I am a part of the [RiskEcon Lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/cecada/) at the university.

I graduated from [Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore](https://www.amrita.edu/school/engineering/coimbatore) in 2016 with a Bachelors in Computer Science & Engineering. During this time I worked on a BlackBox Challenge using Reinforcement Learning at [Politecnico di Milano, Italy](https://www.polimi.it/en/) and on Indoor Localization. I started my professional career at [Siemens Technology & Services Pvt Ltd.](https://www.siemens.com/in/en/home.html), Bengaluru as a Research Engineer. Here I worked in the field of applied research where Machine Learning was applied to Software Engineering problems.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn more and apply ML to interesting problems. If you would like to discuss a great idea or have a long chat on the latest book you read, you can ping me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phm26/).
